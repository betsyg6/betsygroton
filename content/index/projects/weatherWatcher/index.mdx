Weather Watcher is a Google Chrome Extension that was developed to demonstrated the impact that global warming has had on weather. It uses Geolocation API, OpenWeatherMap API, WorldWeatherOnline API, and GNews API to gather data. The chart was created using Victory.js, and it shows how the temperature has changed over time for a specific location.
