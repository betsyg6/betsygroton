Hey! I'm Betsy.

Originally from Westwood, Massachusetts, I went to college at Miami University of Ohio and studied Mass Communications with a minor in Interactive Media Studies. It was here that I first began my coding journey with an Intro to Web Development course. I built a very basic website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Although I was interested in web development, I thought it was too late in my studies to explore it further, and ultimately accepted an offer to join the 2013 Teach for America corps. I taught for two years in a small town outside Cleveland, Mississippi, then continued teaching for five more years in Brooklyn, New York. Teaching ignited my passion for leadership, educational equity, and social justice. I also learned how to motivate, inspire, and effectively communicate with others.

My interest in coding re-emerged when I taught an after school program called Kids Who Code, and taught students coding fundamentals using Code.org and Scratch. I saw how fulfilled and empowered my students became when they solved a difficult problem, and I decided I'd try to teach myself how to code as well! Now, after attending the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy of Code, I'm looking for a full time software engineering position.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually playing with my dog, running, cycling, rollerskating, or playing ukulele.
